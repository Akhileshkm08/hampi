                  The Virupaksha Temple is believed to have been originally established in the 7th century during the Chalukya dynasty, with references to it found in ancient texts and inscriptions. The earliest structure in the temple complex was built by the Chalukya King Vikramaditya II (c. 733-744 CE) to honor Lord Shiva in his form as Virupaksha.
